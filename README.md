# SmartForm Filler - Chrome Extension

## Overview

SmartForm Filler is the Chrome extension equivalent of a caffeinated wizard riding a unicorn through a glitter storm—it zaps form data, summons AI from the Gemini galaxy, and yeets answers into fields faster than you can scream, "WHY IS THIS FORM SO LONG?!" Say adios to manual typing and hello to lazy automation sassier than a reality TV diva.

## Features

- **Form-Sniffing Superpower**: Detects forms like a truffle pig on a divine quest—even sniffs out Google Forms like a pro.
- **AI Brainiac**: Chats with the Gemini API to answer questions and options in Google Forms because humans are _so_ last millennium.
- **Auto-Fill Chaos**: Slams answers into fields like a toddler hyped on pixie sticks—Google Form multiple-choice? Nailed it!
- **Popup Palooza**: A UI so clickable it’s basically winking at you with a “come hither” vibe.

## Installation

1. **Steal the Treasure**:

   - Snag `dist.zip`. It’s the digital loot drop of your dreams, minus the pirate eyepatch.

2. **Unleash the Beast**:

   - Unzip that bad boy into a folder—name it `SmartFormFiller` or something epic like `FormSlayer3000`. It’s like cracking a piñata full of code candy, but stickier.

3. **Chrome Shenanigans**:
   - Waddle to `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome—don’t trip over your 47 open cat meme tabs.
   - Flip **Developer mode** on like you’re in a hacker flick with too much neon.
   - Smash **Load unpacked**, aim at your unzipped folder, and cackle as it crash-lands in your toolbar like a triumphant alien overlord.

## Usage

1. **Find a Victim**: Stagger onto a webpage with a form—Google Forms, sketchy surveys, whatever tickles your fancy (even that creepy one asking for your soul’s ZIP code).
2. **Summon the Gremlin**: Click the **SmartForm Filler** icon in your toolbar—it’s the smug little chaos agent smirking at you.
3. **Face the Sass**: The popup hits you with a “👋 motherfucker, Are you ready to ✂️📝!!”—because this extension doesn’t mess around.
4. **Pick Your Poison**:
   - **Google Form Mode**: Check the “It’s Google Form” box if you’re wrestling with one of Google’s bureaucratic masterpieces. It’ll sniff out questions and options—multiple-choice, short answer, you name it—and slap in answers like a quiz-show champ. Leave it checked (it’s the default, you lazy legend).
   - **Custom Chaos Mode**: Uncheck that box and toss in a class or ID (e.g., `.jay` or `#jay`) for those rogue forms that don’t bow to Google’s tyranny. It’s like handing the extension a treasure map to the form’s secret lair.
5. **Unleash the Beast**: Slam the **"Get Answers"** button like it’s a dance-off with your arch-nemesis. The extension snatches form data, gossips with the AI faster than your auntie at a hair salon, and parachutes answers into fields like glitter-dusted ninjas—even nailing Google Form options like a boss.
6. **Bask in Glory**: Review the AI’s brilliance (it’s probably smarter than us all), hit submit, and strut away like you just won a staring contest with the internet.

## Permissions

We’re sneaking into some browser nooks—don’t freak, it’s for your own good:

- `storage`: To stash temp junk, not your secret dank meme hoard.
- `tabs`: To eyeball your current tab—no judgment on your 3 AM conspiracy rabbit holes.
- `scripting`: To graffiti pages with answers like a digital Banksy.
- `host_permissions`: `<all_urls>`—we’re the nosiest neighbor in Extension Town.

## Notes

- You’ll need an API key, or this is just a sassy paperweight. Beg, borrow, or steal one (legally, duh).
- We don’t hoard your data—swear on our binary soul. It’s a quick AI whisper and poof, gone.
- Done with our antics? Boot us out at `chrome://extensions/`—we’ll sob into our pixelated hankies.

## How to Contribute

Hey, you! Yeah, you with the keyboard and caffeine stash—wanna join the party? I’d love for you to hop aboard this glitter unicorn ride. Here’s how to contribute to SmartForm Filler’s glorious chaos:

1. **Fork It**: Grab the repo from [insert GitHub repo link—don’t make me hunt for it] and fork it like it’s a plastic spork at a picnic.
2. **Clone the Madness**: Yank that forked repo to your machine—`git clone` it like you’re stealing candy from a piñata.
3. **Hack Away**: Tinker with the code—add features, fix bugs, or make it sing karaoke. Check out `App.jsx` for the popup sass or go wild elsewhere.
4. **Test the Beast**: Load your hacked version into Chrome (see Installation above) and see if it still yells “👋 motherfucker” without crashing.
5. **PR Time**: Shove your changes into a pull request like you’re stuffing a turkey. Describe your brilliance—or at least why it didn’t blow up.
6. **Bask in Fame**: If I dig it, your code joins the glitter storm, and you get bragging rights as a co-conspirator!

No idea where to start? Smash that “Issues” tab on GitHub and pick a fight with a bug, or suggest something nutty like auto-filling forms with dank memes. All skill levels welcome—bring coffee and chaos!

## Future Improvements

- Tackling weirder forms—like those designed by a mad scientist after a Red Bull binge.
- AI answer filters—because “pineapple” as your zip code is peak comedy.
- UI so dazzling you’ll need shades, a snack, and a nap to handle the glow-up.
